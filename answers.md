_"Of course,"_ she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is **a little moxie**!"

If you're thinking to yourself, _**This is unbelievable**_, you'd probably be right.

I read this interesting quote the other day:

> "Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"

>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...
>
>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.
>
>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.

>He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: _VIVE L'IRLANDE_!

1. Cut the cheese
2. Slice the tomatoes
3. Rub the tomatoes in flour

1. Cut the cheese

 Make sure that the cheese is cut into little triangles.

2. Slice the tomatoes

 Be careful when holding the knife.

 For more help on tomato slicing, see Thomas Jefferson's seminal essay _Tom Ate Those_.

We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.  

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.  
Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.  
If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.  
Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

## Exercise 2

# Markup languages

**SGML**, in full **standard generalized markup language**, an international _computer_ standard for the definition of markup languages; that is, it is a metalanguage. Markup consists of notations called “tags,” which specify the function of a piece of text or how it is to be displayed. SGML _emphasizes_ descriptive markup, in which a tag might be _emphasis_. Such a markup denotes the document function, and it could be interpreted as reverse video on a computer screen, underlining by a typewriter, or italics in typeset text.  
SGML is used to specify **DTD**s (document type definitions). A DTD defines a kind of document, such as a report, by specifying what elements must appear in the document—e.g., _Title_—and by giving rules for the use of document elements, such as that a paragraph may appear within a table entry but a table may not appear within a paragraph. A marked-up text may be analyzed by a parsing program to determine if it conforms to a DTD. Another program may read the markups to prepare an index or to translate the document into **PostScript** for printing. Yet another might generate large or **enhanced** type or audio for readers with visual or hearing disabilities.

**KML, Keyhole Markup Language**, is an XML notation for expressing geographic annotation and visualization within two-dimensional maps and three-dimensional _Earth_ browsers. KML was developed for use with **Google Earth**, which was originally named Keyhole Earth Viewer. It was created by _Keyhole, Inc_, which was acquired by _Google_ in 2004. KML became an international standard of the _Open Geospatial Consortium in 2008_. Google Earth was the first program able to view and graphically edit KML files, but other projects such as _Marble_ have added KML support.
